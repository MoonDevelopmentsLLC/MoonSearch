# MoonSearch
A multi search, "supersearcher" that can be embedded with no noticeable impact on performance. (HTML+SCRIPT))

Free to use modify or whatever, just give moonala.com an attribution or this github. If you improve the code it would be much appreciated if you included the changes here :)

Its purpose is simple, the providers can be interchanged making it a more private but modularly usable "search bar" that can be implanted anywhere that takes html+script. 

Sample use case guide: 
Download the code as a zip or copy the html file directly from github. Paste the code where you want to use it inside of embedding tags.
